This folder is intended to store documentation and helper scripts related to using the repository's fine-grained Personal Access Token (Repo_Fine_Grain_Token).

Guidance:
- Never commit tokens into the repository.
- Use repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions) and reference them in workflows as `${{ secrets.Repo_Fine_Grain_Token }}`.
- If you add automation that pushes changes, create a branch and open a PR (branch-protection-friendly).
